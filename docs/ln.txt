NAME
     ln -- make links

SYNOPSIS
     ln [-fhinsv] source_file [target_file]
     ln [-fhinsv] source_file ... target_dir

DESCRIPTION
     The ln utility creates a new directory entry (linked file) which has the
     same modes as the original file.  It is useful for maintaining multiple
     copies of a file in many places at once without using up storage for the
     ``copies''; instead, a link ``points'' to the original copy.  There are
     two types of links: hard links and symbolic links.  How a link ``points''
     to a file is one of the differences between a hard or symbolic link.

     The options are as follows:

     -f    Unlink any already existing file, permitting the link to occur.

     -h    If the target_file or target_dir is a symbolic link, do not follow
           it.  This is most useful with the -f option, to replace a symlink
           which may point to a directory.

     -i    Cause ln to write a prompt to standard error if the target file
           exists.  If the response from the standard input begins with the
           character `y' or `Y', then unlink the target file so that the link
           may occur.  Otherwise, do not attempt the link.  (The -i option
           overrides any previous -f options.)

     -n    Same as -h, for compatibility with other ln implementations, namely
           GNU coreutils.

     -s    Create a symbolic link.

     -v    Cause ln to be verbose, showing files as they are processed.

     By default ln makes hard links.  A hard link to a file is
     indistinguishable from the original directory entry; any changes to a
     file are effective independent of the name used to reference the file.
     Hard links may not normally refer to directories and may not span file
     systems.

     A symbolic link contains the name of the file to which it is linked.  The
     referenced file is used when an open(2) operation is performed on the
     link.  A stat(2) on a symbolic link will return the linked-to file; an
     lstat(2) must be done to obtain information about the link.  The
     readlink(2) call may be used to read the contents of a symbolic link.
     Symbolic links may span file systems and may refer to directories.

     Given one or two arguments, ln creates a link to an existing file
     source_file.  If target_file is given, the link has that name;
     target_file may also be a directory in which to place the link; otherwise
     it is placed in the current directory.  If only the directory is
     specified, the link will be made to the last component of source_file.

     Given more than two arguments, ln makes links in target_dir to all the
     named source files.  The links made will have the same name as the files
     being linked to.

STANDARDS
     The ln utility conforms to IEEE Std 1003.2-1992 (``POSIX.2'').

     The -v option is an extension to IEEE Std 1003.2-1992 (``POSIX.2'').

HISTORY
     A ln utility appeared in Version 6 AT&T UNIX.
