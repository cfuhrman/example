NAME
       tee - read from standard input and write to standard output and files

SYNOPSIS
tee 22m[4mOPTION24m]... [4mFILE24m]...

DESCRIPTION
       Copy standard input to each FILE, and also to standard output.

-a22m, 1m--append
              append to the given FILEs, do not overwrite

-i22m, 1m--ignore-interrupts
              ignore interrupt signals

-p     22mdiagnose errors writing to non pipes

--output-error22m[=4mMODE24m]
              set behavior on write error.  See MODE below

--help 22mdisplay this help and exit

--version
              output version information and exit

MODE determines behavior with write errors on the outputs:
       'warn' diagnose errors writing to any output

       'warn-nopipe'
              diagnose errors writing to any output not a pipe

       'exit' exit on error writing to any output

       'exit-nopipe'
              exit on error writing to any output not a pipe

       The default MODE for the 1m-p 22moption is 'warn-nopipe'.  The default oper-
       ation when 1m--output-error 22mis not specified, is to exit  immediately  on
       error  writing  to a pipe, and diagnose errors writing to non pipe out-
       puts.
