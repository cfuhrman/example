     For each operand that names a _f_i_l_e of a type other than directory, llss
     displays its name as well as any requested, associated information.  For
     each operand that names a _f_i_l_e of type directory, llss displays the names
     of files contained within that directory, as well as any requested, asso-
     ciated information.

     If no operands are given, the contents of the current directory are dis-
     played.  If more than one operand is given, non-directory operands are
     displayed first; directory and non-directory operands are sorted sepa-
     rately and in lexicographical order.

     The following options are available:

     --AA      List all entries except for `.' and `..'.  Always set for the
             super-user.

     --aa      Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (`.').

     --BB      Force printing of non-graphic characters in file names as \xxx,
             where xxx is the numeric value of the character in octal.

     --bb      As --BB, but use C escape codes whenever possible.

     --CC      Force multi-column output; this is the default when output is to
             a terminal.

     --cc      Use time when file status was last changed, instead of time of
             last modification of the file for sorting (--tt) or printing (--ll).

     --dd      Directories are listed as plain files (not searched recursively)
             and symbolic links in the argument list are not followed.

     --FF      Display a slash (`/') immediately after each pathname that is a
             directory, an asterisk (`*') after each that is executable, an at
             sign (`@') after each symbolic link, a percent sign (`%') after
             each whiteout, an equal sign (`=') after each socket, and a ver-
             tical bar (`|') after each that is a FIFO.

     --ff      Output is not sorted.

     --gg      The same as --ll, except that the owner is not printed.

     --hh      Modifies the --ss and --ll options, causing the sizes to be reported
             in bytes displayed in a human readable format.  Overrides --kk and
             --MM.

     --ii      For each file, print the file's file serial number (inode num-
             ber).

     --kk      Modifies the --ss option, causing the sizes to be reported in kilo-
             bytes.  The rightmost of the --kk and --hh flags overrides the previ-
             ous flag.  See also --hh and --MM.

     --LL      For each file, if it's a link, evaluate file information and file
             type of the referenced file and not the link itself; however
             still print the link name, unless used with --ll, for example.

     --ll      (The lowercase letter ``ell'').  List in long format.  (See
             below.)  A total sum for all the file sizes is output on a line
             before the long listing.

     --MM      Modifies the --ll and --ss options, causing the sizes or block counts
             reported to be separated with commas (or a locale appropriate
             separator) resulting in a more readable output.  Overrides --hh.
             Does not override --kk.

     --mm      Stream output format; list files across the page, separated by
             commas.

     --nn      The same as --ll, except that the owner and group IDs are displayed
             numerically rather than converting to a owner or group name.

     --oo      Include the file flags in a long (--ll) output.  If no file flags
             are set, ``-'' is displayed.  (See chflags(1) for a list of pos-
             sible flags and their meanings.)

     --pp      Display a slash (`/') immediately after each pathname that is a
             directory.

     --qq      Force printing of non-printable characters in file names as the
             character `?'; this is the default when output is to a terminal.

     --RR      Recursively list subdirectories encountered.

     --rr      Reverse the order of the sort to get reverse lexicographical
             order or the smallest or oldest entries first.

     --SS      Sort by size, largest file first.

     --ss      Display the number of file system blocks actually used by each
             file, in units of 512 bytes or BLOCKSIZE (see _E_N_V_I_R_O_N_M_E_N_T) where
             partial units are rounded up to the next integer value.  If the
             output is to a terminal, a total sum for all the file sizes is
             output on a line before the listing.

     --TT      When used with the --ll (the lowercase letter ``ell'') option, dis-
             play complete time information for the file, including month,
             day, hour, minute, second, and year.

     --tt      Sort by time modified (most recently modified first) before sort-
             ing the operands by lexicographical order.

     --uu      Use time of last access, instead of last modification of the file
             for sorting (--tt) or printing (--ll).

     --WW      Display whiteouts when scanning directories.

     --ww      Force raw printing of non-printable characters.  This is the
             default when output is not to a terminal.

     --xx      Multi-column output sorted across the page rather than down the
             page.

     --11      (The numeric digit ``one'').  Force output to be one entry per
             line.  This is the default when output is not to a terminal.

     The --BB, --bb, --ww, and --qq options all override each other; the last one
     specified determines the format used for non-printable characters.

     The --11, --CC, --gg, --ll, --mm, and --xx options all override each other; the last
     one specified determines the format used with the exception that if both
     --ll and --gg are specified, --ll will always override --gg, even if --gg was spec-
     ified last.

     The --cc and --uu options override each other; the last one specified deter-
     mines the file time used.

     By default, llss lists one entry per line to standard output; the excep-
     tions are to terminals or when the --CC or --mm options are specified.

     File information is displayed with one or more <blank> separating the
     information associated with the --ii, --ss, and --ll options.

   TThhee LLoonngg FFoorrmmaatt
     If the --ll option is given, the following information is displayed for
     each file:
           file mode
           number of links
           owner name
           group name
           file flags (if --oo given)
           number of bytes in the file
           abbreviated month file was last modified
           day-of-month file was last modified
           hour and minute file was last modified
           pathname

     In addition, for each directory whose contents are displayed, the total
     number of 512-byte blocks used by the files in the directory is displayed
     on a line by itself immediately before the information for the files in
     the directory.

     If the owner or group names are not a known owner or group name, or the
     --nn option is given, the numeric ID's are displayed.

     If the file is a character special or block special file, the major and
     minor device numbers for the file are displayed in the size field.  If
     the file is a symbolic link the pathname of the linked-to file is pre-
     ceded by ``->''.

     The file mode printed under the --ll option consists of the entry type,
     owner permissions, group permissions, and other permissions.  The entry
     type character describes the type of file, as follows:

           aa     Archive state 1.
           AA     Archive state 2.
           bb     Block special file.
           cc     Character special file.
           dd     Directory.
           ll     Symbolic link.
           ss     Socket link.
           pp     FIFO.
           ww     Whiteout.
           --     Regular file.

     The next three fields are three characters each: owner permissions, group
     permissions, and other permissions.  Each field has three character posi-
     tions:

           1.   If rr, the file is readable; if --, it is not readable.

           2.   If ww, the file is writable; if --, it is not writable.

           3.   The first of the following that applies:

                      SS     If in the owner permissions, the file is not exe-
                            cutable and set-user-ID mode is set.  If in the
                            group permissions, the file is not executable and
                            set-group-ID mode is set.

                      ss     If in the owner permissions, the file is exe-
                            cutable and set-user-ID mode is set.  If in the
                            group permissions, the file is executable and set-
                            group-ID mode is set.

                      xx     The file is executable or the directory is search-
                            able.

                      --     The file is neither readable, writable, exe-
                            cutable, nor set-user-ID nor set-group-ID mode,
                            nor sticky.  (See below.)

                These next two apply only to the third character in the last
                group (other permissions).

                      TT     The sticky bit is set (mode 1000), but not execute
                            or search permission.  (See chmod(1) or
                            sticky(7).)

                      tt     The sticky bit is set (mode 1000), and is search-
                            able or executable.  (See chmod(1) or sticky(7).)

     The number of bytes displayed for a directory is a function of the number
     of dirent(3) structures in the directory, not all of which may be allo-
     cated to any existing file.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
     The following environment variables affect the execution of llss:

     BLOCKSIZE  If the environment variable BLOCKSIZE is set, and the --hh and
                --kk options are not specified, the block counts (see --ss) will
                be displayed in units of that size block.

     COLUMNS    If this variable contains a string representing a decimal
                integer, it is used as the column position width for display-
                ing multiple-text-column output.  The llss utility calculates
                how many pathname text columns to display based on the width
                provided.  (See --CC.)

     TZ         The timezone to use when displaying dates.  See environ(7) for
                more information.

EEXXIITT SSTTAATTUUSS
     The llss utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

CCOOMMPPAATTIIBBIILLIITTYY
     The group field is now automatically included in the long listing for
     files in order to be compatible with the IEEE Std 1003.2 (``POSIX.2'')
     specification.

     The llss utility is expected to be a superset of the IEEE Std 1003.2
     (``POSIX.2'') specification.
